### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Nice to meet you :) 
I'm an ethical hacker who focuses on educating other people to learn the in's and out's of cyber security. 
I started my journey in April 2021 next to my day job and share things I learn over at twitter [@maikroservice](https://twitter.com/maikroservice) and in video-form on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@maikroservice)
