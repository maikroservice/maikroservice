### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Nice to meet you :) 
I'm an ethical hacker who focuses on educating other people to learn the in's and out's of cyber security. 
I started my journey in April 2021 next to my day job and share things I learn over at [maikroservice.com](https://maikroservice.com) and live on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/maikroservice)
